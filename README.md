# Album Collector
For my second Capstone Project for DevMountain, I wanted to do something that involved a favorite hobby of mine: collecting and cataloging music. Using Apple's iTunes (now rebranded to Apple Music), and open source programs like Strawberry Music Player formed the concept behind this project. With all that I learned over the course of DevMountain's Python Specialization, my usage of Apple Music and Strawberry, and my understanding of Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy combined, Album Collector was formed!

## MVP
1. Users can register and login to their account
2. Users can add and remove albums to their personal collection
3. Users can rate albums on a scale from 1 to 5
4. Users can create tags to filter their collections
5. Users can add metadata (artists, year of release, genres and formats) to their owned albums

## Future TODO List
- Users can toggle the privacy of their collections
- Users can leave reviews of the albums they own (max characters of 1000 per review)
- Add social media functionality (Twitter, Spotify, YouTube, Soundcloud, etc)
- Backend can retrieve album art via API
- Users can add album art if none can be found from API
